\begin{Abstract}
  In this project ,we implement three modules which will work with 
 each other inorder to analyse and state a person is 
 depressed or not. And the main primary objective of the project is to show
 the percentage to which the user is depressed, 
 thus the user can be directed to the available help services. By combining the results of all of three modules we can easily make decisions and thus by parsing the social media data into the NLP we can state whether a person is depressed or not.

\section{Introduction}
  It is estimated that more than 50\% of teenager’s self harm and suicides were caused by depression[5] . It is also found that the number of human beings ending their life or struggling in their life because of stress and Depression will double in the next five years(‘4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)’). Though it is widely argued what is the main cause of depression, many live without even realising that they struggle from depression . This includes parents of adolescents who needs proper care and support.  And it is also found that more than 70\% of depressed prefer not to talk about their issues with others, since they are scared of being bullied and misjudged[4]. The recent research works have shown how social network and mental health correlate with each other , thus by analysing one’s social network preference can determine how mentally sound they are[3].
  And this is where we hope that using an Artificial Intelligence[1] as an intermediate to analyse the behaviour of the person can help and identify the depression level and thus can help them to find proper support. We intend to use the social network data from sites like facebook and also setting up questionnaires over a period of month to obtain the needed data . One of the main work done is similar field is by Microsoft research division[2] provided us with the needed base works, we found that the research work utilizes NLP to compare with the already defined dataset. And we intend to use similar approach but also use the Tags used by the user and associating them with the questionnaires.

\section{Project Description}

The project can be described interms of modules for easier understanding. The primary objective is to compare the modules and thus we can provide an effective result. The project uses the Natural language Toolkit along with SKLearn API to implement Naive Bayes Classifier. The NLTK provides us with all the needed tools such as Tokenizer, tagger parts of speech tagger. and SKlearn API provides us with the needed classifier maodules. The effective but simple way for the project to succed we are gathering the user datas over a period of a month. Our objective was to analyses every weekend thus the major activities can be discovered. 


\section{Questionare Module}
The first module of the project in which we ask user a set of five questions over a period of a month. This questions are defined by psycologiest to detect the depression . Inother words each question has its own weightage thus at the end of the five questions those who score more then 20 can be considered high risk and those who score between 15 to 20 as medium and less then 15 as low risk. This modules helps us to identify and erradicate the false positive while analysing the social media data. A typical set of quetionare will be as of : 
1. Have you slept properly this week?. 
2. How was your week interms of happiness?.
3. Have you ever felt sad the whole week?.
4. will you say your week was upto your satisfaction?

And the answers for this module will be of numerals 0 to 5 . Once the module executes for the first time , it will calculate the score as per the input of the user and categorise the user. If the user fall under High risk range his social media data will be analysed immediately . If he falls under medium category he will be made to take the test again after a week but still the social media data will be analysed for comparition.For this project we used a simple python based command prompt through which the user can interact with the module. 





\subsection{Social Media module}

The second module of the project deals with obtaining user access token to obtain the social media data . We made using facepy[] an API which makes it simple to use graph API from Facebook. The facepy APi provides us with graph.get method using which we obtained the user posts. The obtained data will be in json formot thus we used pickling to dump the data to python object. Thus we can use a dictionary class to obtain specific data else parse the total python object to classifier since the classifier has methods to differentiate symbols and characters.  




\subsection{Classifier module}

The crucial part of the project was designing the classifier which can differentiate whether the provided sentence is happy or sad. Inorder to do this we followed a simple sentiment analyser method which uses naive bayes classiers to find the frequency distribution of words. Before calling the Naive bayes classifier we uses Tokenizer method provided by NLTK API[] to tokenize the training datasets and NLTK corpora provides us with all the needed datasets one prime dataset we used is words() which provides words with their sysnonyms and exampls. Thus by comparing the dataset using the corpora and by specifying that how a happy sentence should look like we can classify the training dataset. 

So, far there are no datasets specified especially for happy or sad . Thus, we assumed a fact that all the positive sentences will be happy and the negative sentences will be sad. Thus, instead classifying the datasets as positive and negative we made it as happy and sad . Inorder to classify the training datasets with atmost accuracy we have used BernoulliNB_classifier,LogisticRegression_classifie,SGDClassifier_classifier, LinearSVC_classifier, NuSVC_classifier




Every submission should begin with an abstract of about 150 words,
followed by a set of keywords. The abstract and keywords should be
placed in the left column of the first page under the left half of the
title. The abstract should be a concise statement of the problem,
approach and conclusions of the work described.  It should clearly
state the paper's contribution to the field of HCI.

The first set of keywords will be used to index the paper in the
proceedings. The second set are used to catalogue the paper in the ACM
Digital Library. The latter are entries from the ACM Classification
System~\cite{acm_categories}.  In general, it should only be necessary
to pick one or more of the H5 subcategories, see
http://www.acm.org/class/1998/H.5.html

\subsection{Integration of modules}

Please use a 10-point Times Roman font or, if this is unavailable,
another proportional font with serifs, as close as possible in
appearance to Times Roman 10-point. The Press 10-point font available
to users of Script is a good substitute for Times Roman. If Times
Roman is not available, try the font named Computer Modern Roman. On a
Macintosh, use the font named Times and not Times New Roman. Please
use sans-serif or non-proportional fonts only for special purposes,
such as headings or source code text.

\section{Analysis of Result}

I had a great day at the pool today.
('Happy', 0.7)

In this example the
I am very happy.
('Depressed', 0.8)

I am not happy.
('Happy', 0.8)

Furthermore, our program isn't able to recognize certain keywords like "Happy" as being depression negative. This can be attributed to our training data set being . Because we lacked an accurate training set for depression "What do depressed people say?" Our basic assumption which was negative movie reviews implies a negative statement does not hold true in this regard, and because of that some of our results are inaccurate. Also, the accuracy of our program depends on long term results, this is because the state of someone's mind can't be completely assessed by a single post, but it can b The more information it has. So

On pages beyond the first, start at the top of the page and continue
in double-column format.  The two columns on the last page should be
of equal length.

Overall this project was successful. Our program has issues in classif
